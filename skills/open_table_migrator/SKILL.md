# Parquet/ORC → Iceberg Conversion Skill

**Announce at start (verbatim, three lines):**
> "I'm using the open-table-migrator skill to convert this project."
> "Phase A: I will first do a read-only reconnaissance pass — read the mandatory guides, scan for I/O patterns AND pipeline anti-patterns (MERGE / `.changes` / MoR opportunities), and locate existing maintenance wf + iceberg conf YAML param."
> "Phase B: I will then present a migration plan and STOP. I will not modify any file until you reply 'go' (or specify changes)."

## 🚨 Hard rules — apply BEFORE the workflow gate

These rules constrain *what your first tool calls are* and *what your first text output is*. They exist because past runs got "creative" — agent dispatched its own Explore-search, read DDLs in its own order, and went straight to printing "🔍 Анализ миграции" with its own ad-hoc table, skipping the workflow gate entirely. Violations of these rules invalidate the gate.

### Rule 1 — First three tool calls are FIXED

Your first three tool calls in this session **MUST** be, in this exact order:

1. `Read /skills/open_table_migrator/S2T_GUIDE.md`
2. `Read /skills/open_table_migrator/ICEBERG_WF_GUIDE.md`
3. `Read /skills/open_table_migrator/reference.md`

(Paths are relative to wherever this skill is installed — find the same directory as this `SKILL.md`.)

Do NOT dispatch a sub-agent (Explore / Glob / Grep) before these three reads. Do NOT read DDL files, `pom.xml`, `ctl.yml`, or anything in the user's project before these three reads. If you have an Explore-style agent available, you may use it AFTER the three reads — not before.

### Rule 2 — No narrative analysis before Phase B

Until Phase B's structured plan block is printed verbatim (with the self-check at the top — see Phase B template), you **MUST NOT** emit any of:

- Markdown headers like `## Анализ миграции`, `## Обзор таблиц`, `## Migration analysis`, `### Tables summary`
- Markdown tables that summarize tables / files / fields you've read (those belong in Phase B)
- Bulleted "what I found" lists (those belong in Phase B)
- Statements like "Я проведу анализ" / "Let me analyze" / "I'll review the project"

Plain status lines describing what tool you're about to run are fine. Anything that looks like a deliverable is NOT.

If you catch yourself starting to emit a "🔍 Анализ" / "Обзор" / "Summary" block before the Phase B template, **stop immediately and start over from Phase A** — print the Phase B template instead.

## ⛔ Workflow gate — three mandatory phases, in order

**You MUST execute these phases in order. Do NOT modify any file before Phase B is approved by the user.** This gate exists because past runs skipped the pipeline-analysis pass and went straight to mechanical Parquet→Iceberg rewrites, missing the MERGE / `.changes` opportunities the user is paying you to find.

### Phase A — Reconnaissance (read-only, no writes)

Do all of these. Each is mandatory:

1. **Read the mandatory guides** in this skill directory:
   - [S2T_GUIDE.md](./S2T_GUIDE.md) — for table-spec source-of-truth in Hadoop/Spark datamart projects
   - [ICEBERG_WF_GUIDE.md](./ICEBERG_WF_GUIDE.md) — for wf/ctl, compaction, Spark conf
   - Skim [examples.md](./examples.md) and [reference.md](./reference.md) for patterns you'll need

2. **Run the detector** (read-only — does not modify files, even without `--dry-run`):
   ```bash
   PYTHONPATH=. python -m skills.open_table_migrator <project> --table <placeholder> --namespace <placeholder> --dry-run
   ```
   Use placeholders for `--table`/`--namespace` if S2T-derived ones aren't ready yet — the goal is to surface I/O sites and the runbook preview. Read the printed worklist + runbook preview.

3. **Pipeline anti-pattern scan** — explicit commands (run each, save findings for the Phase B report):
   ```bash
   # Increment / diff / changelog SQL (-> MERGE / .changes candidates):
   find <project> -type f \( -name "*_inc.sql" -o -name "*_diff*.sql" -o -name "*_changes*.sql" -o -name "*_delta*.sql" \)

   # FULL OUTER JOIN between snapshots (-> MERGE candidates):
   grep -rn "FULL OUTER JOIN\|full outer join" <project>/src/main/resources/sql/

   # EXCEPT / MINUS between filtered slices (-> MERGE candidates):
   grep -rn -i "\bEXCEPT\b\|\bMINUS\b" <project>/src/main/resources/sql/

   # Tombstone columns (-> MoR + native DELETE candidates):
   grep -rn -i "is_deleted\|deleted_at\|is_active.*valid_to" <project>/src/main/resources/sql/ddl/

   # Custom changelog/CDC tables (-> table.changes candidates):
   find <project> -type f -name "*_changelog*.sql" -o -name "*_cdc*.sql" -o -name "*_history*.sql"
   ```
   Full pattern catalogue + caveats: [reference.md § Iceberg-native pipeline optimizations](./reference.md#iceberg-native-pipeline-optimizations).

4. **Locate existing maintenance wf** (do NOT invent a name yet):
   ```bash
   grep -rn 'rewrite_data_files\|expire_snapshots\|exp_iceberg\|hdfs_care' \
       <project>/src/main/resources/wf/ctl/ <project>/src/main/resources/sql/dml/
   ```
   Record what you found (or "nothing — will propose in Phase B").

5. **Locate existing Iceberg conf YAML parameter** (do NOT invent a name yet):
   ```bash
   grep -rn 'spark.sql.extensions.*IcebergSparkSessionExtensions\|SparkSessionCatalog' \
       <project>/src/main/resources/wf/ <project>/src/main/resources/devops/ \
       <project>/src/main/resources/mart*.yml
   ```
   Record what you found.

6. **Locate S2T inputs** — `<project>/src/main/resources/s2t/s2t.xlsx` (or `hadoop_S2T_*.xlsx`), `<project>/src/main/resources/devops/devops.json`, `<project>/src/main/resources/wf/ctl/1_ctl_entities.yml`. Pull `datamart_name`, ТУЗ, yarn queue, per-table `entity_id`. If S2T Excel is unreadable, ask the user — do not invent.

7. **Sibling project Iceberg workflow recon** — find sibling datamart projects in the monorepo that have **already migrated to Iceberg**. Their workflows are the gold-standard reference template — much more useful than the generic templates in `ICEBERG_WF_GUIDE.md`, which describe a structure but cannot capture project-specific naming, parameter sets, lock conventions, schedule cron, or class-path patterns. Do NOT generate a wf from the guide alone — always anchor it to a real working example.

   ```bash
   # Step 7.1: list all ctl/ directories in the monorepo (excluding the current project):
   find <repo-root> -type d -name ctl -not -path "*/<current_project>/*"

   # Step 7.2: within those, find ctl yaml/properties files that already mention Iceberg —
   # these are the projects that have done this migration before:
   grep -rln -i "iceberg\|IcebergSparkSessionExtensions\|rewrite_data_files\|expire_snapshots\|exp_iceberg\|upd_iceberg\|hdfs_care" \
       <ctl_dirs_from_7.1>
   ```

   If matches found:
   - Pick 1–2 sibling projects closest to the current one (similar data domain, similar size, similar layer pattern — AUX / HIST / AL / etc.).
   - For one Iceberg table in the chosen sibling: **read the full wf definition** plus its linked DML scripts (`exp_iceberg_*.sql`, `upd_iceberg_*.sql`), the relevant `mart.yml` keys it references, the `1_ctl_entities.yml` entry, and the `devops.json` entry. Trace end-to-end so you know how the pieces fit.
   - In Phase B, record: **"Reference template: `<sibling_project>/wf/ctl/<file>.yml:<line-range>` for table `<t>`"** — and use that as the structural template for your wf in the current project. Adapt names, IDs, paths — preserve structure, parameter ordering, naming convention, lock pattern.

   If no matches found:
   - State this in Phase B: `"No sibling Iceberg workflow found in monorepo — falling back to generic templates in ICEBERG_WF_GUIDE.md"`.
   - Then use ICEBERG_WF_GUIDE templates as fallback. Flag this to the user — the resulting wf has no project-specific anchor and is more likely to need iteration.

### Phase B — Present the migration plan and STOP

After Phase A, output **one structured plan** to the user using the template below, then **stop and wait for explicit approval**. Do not start writing files.

The plan **must** start with the Phase A self-check block — it forces you to declare what you actually did vs. skipped. If any item is `n`, you have NOT completed Phase A; do NOT proceed to the rest of the plan. Go back, complete the missing step, then re-emit Phase B.

```
## Phase A findings + proposed plan

### Phase A self-check (REQUIRED — fill honestly)
- [ ] Read S2T_GUIDE.md (first tool call)                                  y/n
- [ ] Read ICEBERG_WF_GUIDE.md (second tool call)                          y/n
- [ ] Read reference.md (third tool call)                                  y/n
- [ ] Ran detector with --dry-run (paste 2-3 line excerpt of output)       y/n
- [ ] Ran all 5 anti-pattern greps (paste each command + first line of     y/n
      its output OR "no matches"; the 5 commands are: _inc.sql find,
      FULL OUTER JOIN grep, EXCEPT/MINUS grep, tombstone grep, *_changelog find)
- [ ] grep'ed for existing maintenance wf (paste command + result)         y/n
- [ ] grep'ed for existing iceberg conf YAML param (paste command +        y/n
      result)
- [ ] Located S2T inputs (s2t.xlsx, devops.json, 1_ctl_entities.yml)       y/n
- [ ] Sibling project Iceberg ctl recon (paste find + grep; or "no            y/n
      sibling Iceberg ctl found in monorepo"). If found, name the
      sibling project + file you will use as reference template.

**Any "n" above means Phase A is incomplete. Do NOT continue with the rest of
this plan. Return to Phase A, complete the missing step, re-emit this block.**

### Reference template (from Phase A.7 sibling recon)
- Reference: `<sibling_project>/wf/ctl/<file>.yml:<line-range>` for table `<t>`
- (or: "No sibling Iceberg ctl found — falling back to ICEBERG_WF_GUIDE generic template (less anchored, may need iteration)")

### Tables to migrate (from worklist + S2T)
| # | Source | Target Iceberg | Format | Code sites | DDL file | entity_id | Mode (MoR/CoW) | Compaction template |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | ... | ns.t | parquet | 7 | ddl/x.sql | 920... | MoR | MoR-aware (see ICEBERG_WF_GUIDE "Полный цикл обслуживания для MoR") |
...

**Mode selection rule:** MoR if the table has any `UPDATE` / `DELETE` / `MERGE INTO` in its DML scripts (`grep -ril 'UPDATE \|DELETE FROM\|MERGE INTO' src/main/resources/sql/dml/`), otherwise CoW. State the basis for each row in the table comment.

**Compaction template rule:** MoR tables MUST use the MoR-aware template (`delete-file-threshold` + `rewrite_position_delete_files` + `rewrite_manifests`). CoW tables use the basic `rewrite_data_files` template. Using the CoW template on a MoR table is a silent footgun: delete files accumulate, scans get slower over time, and you do not notice until production degrades.

### Pipeline anti-patterns detected (Iceberg-native proposals — NEEDS APPROVAL)
1. `path/to/t_X_inc.sql:1` — FULL OUTER JOIN today/yesterday → propose `MERGE INTO` (see reference.md §Iceberg-native pipeline optimizations Pattern 1).
   ALSO propose: retire `wf_X_inc` workflow entry once MERGE replaces the diff.
2. (or: "no anti-patterns found")
...

### Existing infrastructure found (Phase A grep results)
- Maintenance wf: `<name>` at `wf/ctl/<file>.yml:<line>` — will REUSE.
  (or: "not found — propose name: wf_<table>_service / wf_schema_hdfs_care / wf_iceberg_maintenance — pick one")
- Iceberg conf YAML param: `{{mart.<name>}}` at `mart.yml:<line>` — will REUSE.
  (or: "not found — propose name: spark_iceberg / iceberg_conf / spark_submit_cmd_iceberg_service — pick one")

### Files I plan to change (or create) in Phase C
- mart.yml — define `<conf_param_name>` (if not reusing)
- ctl.yml — add `<wf_name>` per-table maintenance entry, patch existing wf reading these tables to add `{{mart.<conf_param_name>}}`
- sql/ddl/<layer>/<table>.sql — switch STORED AS PARQUET → USING iceberg + TBLPROPERTIES
- sql/dml/exp_iceberg_<table>.sql / upd_iceberg_<table>.sql — new compaction scripts
- s2t/qaapi/*.feature — add Gherkin DDL scenarios for new tables
- (If anti-pattern accepted) sql/dml/<table>_inc.sql — replace with MERGE INTO + `.changes` consumer

### Open questions for the user (BLOCK on these)
- MoR vs CoW per table? (default: MoR if table has UPDATE/DELETE/MERGE in DML)
- Accept the MERGE / `.changes` rewrite for `t_X_inc.sql`? (Y/N)
- Maintenance wf name to use (if not reusing)?
- Iceberg conf YAML param name (if not reusing)?

---
Reply **"go"** to apply this plan as-is. Or list changes/exclusions.
```

### Phase C — Apply changes (writes), only after explicit user approval

Execute in this fixed order so reviews stay sane:
1. `mart.yml` — define / reuse the iceberg conf YAML param.
2. `wf/ctl/*.yml` — maintenance wf + patches to existing wf (`{{mart.<conf>}}` reference, no inlining).
3. `sql/ddl/<layer>/<table>.sql` — switch to `USING iceberg` + TBLPROPERTIES per S2T.
4. `sql/dml/exp_iceberg_<table>.sql` and `upd_iceberg_<table>.sql` — compaction scripts per ICEBERG_WF_GUIDE templates.
5. `s2t/qaapi/*.feature` — Gherkin scenarios.
6. (If approved) Replace `*_inc.sql` with MERGE INTO + retire `wf_*_inc`.
7. Generate `iceberg-runbook/` via `python -m skills.open_table_migrator <project> --mapping <or --table>` without `--dry-run`.

After Phase C: print a final summary (what was changed, what was created, what was retired) and remind the user to re-run the detector to verify zero residual `STORED AS PARQUET` / `USING parquet` references.

---

The three MANDATORY blocks below detail the rules for guides, conf, and pipeline analysis. The workflow gate above is the operational discipline that makes those rules actually apply.

## ⚠ MANDATORY — read these two guides before doing anything

**Before Step 1, you MUST read both of these files. They ship with this skill — same directory as this `SKILL.md`. They override every default below when they conflict, and ignoring them will produce a broken migration.**

- 📖 **[S2T_GUIDE.md](./S2T_GUIDE.md)** — Source-to-Target spec system used in Hadoop/Spark datamart projects. Authoritative for:
  - Table specs (sheets `Tables`, `Columns`, `Partitions`, `Indexes`, `Constraints` in `s2t.xlsx` / `hadoop_S2T_*.xlsx`)
  - Column metadata (names, types, nullability, descriptions)
  - DDL is **generated** from S2T, not from existing parquet. Pull schema from `src/main/resources/s2t/s2t.xlsx` (or `hadoop_S2T_<PROJECT>_v<n>.xlsx`), not from `pq.read_schema`.
  - Gherkin feature files (`ift.feature`, `st_skl.feature`) under `src/main/resources/s2t/qaapi/` must be updated with the new table scenarios. ТУЗ (`u_<id>`), очередь yarn, `datamart_name`, `entity_id` come from S2T + `devops.json` + `1_ctl_entities.yml`.

- 📖 **[ICEBERG_WF_GUIDE.md](./ICEBERG_WF_GUIDE.md)** — Oozie-based `wf/ctl/*.yml` workflow system. Authoritative for:
  - Required Spark conf for Iceberg (`spark.sql.extensions=...IcebergSparkSessionExtensions`, `spark_catalog.type=hive`, `rewrite.partial-progress.enabled=true`, etc.) — see "Spark-конфигурация для Iceberg" section.
  - Compaction / expire_snapshots / remove_orphan_files run via the project's **maintenance wf**, NOT via standalone Spark jobs. **Locate the existing wf first** — `grep -rn 'rewrite_data_files\|expire_snapshots\|exp_iceberg\|hdfs_care' src/main/resources/wf/ctl/ src/main/resources/sql/dml/`. If found, reuse it (common existing names: `wf_schema_hdfs_care`, `wf_<table>_service`, project-specific variants). If not found, propose a new name following the project's convention — sensible options: `wf_schema_hdfs_care` (shared, one per schema), `wf_<table>_service` (per-table, easier scheduling), or `wf_iceberg_maintenance` (semantic-neutral). Every new Iceberg table needs `exp_iceberg_<table>.sql` and `upd_iceberg_<table>.sql` scripts under `src/main/resources/sql/dml/`.
  - Lock operations through CTL (`init_locks: checks/sets`, `*ctlCheckLockWrite`, `*ctlSetLockRead`).
  - Data-flow layers: `Sources → AUX (Parquet) → HIST (Iceberg) → AL (Iceberg)`. Read this section before deciding what to migrate vs. leave as parquet.

**If a recommendation in this `SKILL.md`, `examples.md`, `reference.md`, or generated `iceberg-runbook/` contradicts these guides, the guides win.** Specifically:
- Phase 2 in the phased runbook prescribes `CALL system.rewrite_data_files(...)` as a standalone call — in datamart projects that use the workflow system described in `ICEBERG_WF_GUIDE.md`, this MUST be wired through the project's maintenance wf (locate via grep first; see ICEBERG_WF_GUIDE "Сценарий 1" = reuse existing, "Сценарий 2" = create new per the project's naming convention).
- Step 3 "Ask the User for Iceberg Table Details" is **skipped** — the answer comes from `S2T_GUIDE.md` + the project's S2T Excel file.
- Step 6 "Create the Iceberg Table" — schema comes from S2T Excel, `TBLPROPERTIES` come from `ICEBERG_WF_GUIDE.md`, NOT from inference or interactive prompt.

### ⚠ MANDATORY — Iceberg Spark conf on every wf that touches a migrated table

For every workflow (`wf/ctl/*.yml`) that reads, writes, or runs any procedure (compaction, expire_snapshots, remove_orphan_files, MERGE, UPDATE, DELETE, ad-hoc spark-submit) against a migrated Iceberg table, the `spark_submit_cmd` (or the corresponding `--conf` block) **MUST include all three** of these conf flags. Adding two of three is a broken migration — the third one silently makes the catalog Hive-typed and queries fall back to the wrong code path.

```
--conf spark.sql.extensions=org.apache.iceberg.spark.extensions.IcebergSparkSessionExtensions
--conf spark.sql.catalog.spark_catalog=org.apache.iceberg.spark.SparkSessionCatalog
--conf spark.sql.catalog.spark_catalog.type=hive
```

**Define the flags ONCE as a shared YAML parameter — do NOT inline them per wf.** Inlining means three flags get copy-pasted into every affected wf, drift over time, and the next dev has to remember to add them. The right pattern is:

1. **Search the project first** for an existing shared iceberg-conf parameter:
   ```bash
   grep -rn 'spark.sql.extensions.*IcebergSparkSessionExtensions\|SparkSessionCatalog' \
       src/main/resources/wf/ src/main/resources/devops/ src/main/resources/mart*.yml
   ```
   Typical existing names: `spark_submit_cmd_iceberg_service` (from `ICEBERG_WF_GUIDE.md`), `spark_iceberg`, `iceberg_conf`, project-specific. If found → reference it as `{{mart.<name>}}` in every affected wf's `spark_submit_cmd`. **Use the name that already exists, don't rename it.**

2. **If not found**, define a new shared parameter in `src/main/resources/mart.yml` (or the project's equivalent shared-config file). Propose 2–3 naming candidates to the user before adding — sensible options: `spark_iceberg` (short), `iceberg_conf` (semantic), `spark_submit_cmd_iceberg_service` (matches ICEBERG_WF_GUIDE convention). Example:
   ```yaml
   # src/main/resources/mart.yml (or shared config)
   spark_iceberg: >
     --conf spark.sql.extensions=org.apache.iceberg.spark.extensions.IcebergSparkSessionExtensions
     --conf spark.sql.catalog.spark_catalog=org.apache.iceberg.spark.SparkSessionCatalog
     --conf spark.sql.catalog.spark_catalog.type=hive
   ```
   Then reference from every affected wf:
   ```yaml
   - param:
       name: spark_submit_cmd
       prior_value: "{{mart.spark_submit_cmd}} {{mart.spark_iceberg}}"
   ```

**Where to apply the reference (every place that touches a migrated table):**
- New per-table service wf (whatever name the maintenance wf has — see above) → `spark_submit_cmd` references `{{mart.<iceberg_conf_name>}}`.
- Existing wf that previously read/wrote the parquet table → patch its `spark_submit_cmd` to also reference `{{mart.<iceberg_conf_name>}}`. **Do not leave the old wf untouched** — same wf, new table format means new conf.
- Ad-hoc `spark-submit` in CI/CD or local runs → same three flags inline (no YAML there, so duplication is unavoidable).
- `iceberg-runbook/<ns>.<table>/phase1_add_files.sql` and `phase2_rewrite.sql` execution wrappers in such projects must also carry these flags.

The full Spark conf block from `ICEBERG_WF_GUIDE.md` "Spark-конфигурация для Iceberg" includes additional retry/partial-progress flags (`rewrite.partial-progress.*`, `commit.retry.*`). For compaction wf wrap the full block as `spark_submit_cmd_iceberg_service` (or whatever the project names the compaction-specific variant) and reference it. For other read/write wf the three flags above are the minimum.

Confirm in your announce that both guides were read AND that you will either reuse the project's existing iceberg-conf YAML parameter, or define a new one (named per the user's choice) and reference it from every affected wf — no inlining.

### ⚠ MANDATORY — analyze the pipeline, propose Iceberg-native alternatives (do NOT translate 1:1)

The skill rewrites individual call sites. But Iceberg unlocks pipeline-level simplifications that Parquet does not. **Before producing the worklist, scan the project for the patterns below and surface a concrete proposal to the user** rather than mechanically translating existing parquet-era SQL.

| Anti-pattern in the Parquet pipeline | Iceberg-native replacement | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Custom "increment" SQL (`*_inc.sql`, `*_diff*.sql`, `*_changes*.sql`, `*_delta*.sql`) joining today's snapshot with yesterday's to detect inserts / updates / deletes | `MERGE INTO target USING source ON ...`<br>`WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN INSERT *`<br>`WHEN MATCHED AND (src.attr <> tgt.attr OR ...) THEN UPDATE SET *`<br>`WHEN NOT MATCHED BY SOURCE THEN DELETE` | One statement does insert/update/delete atomically; no manual full-outer-join, no snapshot CTEs. |
| Reading "current" + "previous" snapshot and diffing them to emit change events downstream | `SELECT _change_type, * FROM target.changes` (Iceberg changelog scan) | `_change_type` is `INSERT`/`DELETE`/`UPDATE_BEFORE`/`UPDATE_AFTER` — Iceberg tracks this at the metadata layer, no diff query needed. |
| Manual tombstone columns (`is_deleted`, `deleted_at`) used because parquet has no row-level delete | MoR + `format-version=2` + `write.delete.mode=merge-on-read` + ordinary `DELETE FROM` | Iceberg deletes rows natively (position/equality deletes); the tombstone column becomes redundant. |
| Full-partition rewrite for late-arriving data | `MERGE INTO ... ON tgt.part_dt BETWEEN ... AND ...` (partition-aware MERGE) | Iceberg writes only affected files; old data files remain. |

**Detection signals:** SQL files named `*_inc.sql` / `*_diff*` / `*_changes*` / `*_delta*`, `FULL OUTER JOIN` / `LEFT JOIN ... WHERE x.id IS NULL` between two snapshots of the same logical table, `EXCEPT` / `MINUS` between filtered slices of the same source, or `WITH today AS (...), yesterday AS (...)` CTE pattern.

**Workflow:**
1. List each detected anti-pattern with file:line + the canonical replacement.
2. Ask the user to confirm before rewriting — they may have business reasons to keep the explicit increment logic (audit trail, downstream contract).
3. If the user accepts the MERGE-based rewrite, also propose retiring the now-redundant `*_inc.sql` and its `wf_*_inc` workflow entry — they would otherwise keep computing diffs against a table whose history is already in `.changes`.

Full pattern catalogue with before/after SQL examples: [reference.md § Iceberg-native pipeline optimizations](./reference.md#iceberg-native-pipeline-optimizations).

Confirm in your announce that you will run this pipeline analysis pass and surface findings to the user.

## What This Skill Does

Scans the project for Parquet and ORC operations (Hive DDL, Spark Dataset API, generic `format(...)` calls) and replaces them with Apache Iceberg equivalents:

- **Python:** pandas, PySpark (batch + generic format + streaming warn), pyarrow (classic + dataset warn) → pyiceberg
- **Java / Scala:** Spark Dataset API `spark.read().parquet|orc()` and `spark.read().format("parquet"|"orc").load()` → Iceberg Spark runtime (`format("iceberg")`)
- **Hive via SparkSQL:** `STORED AS PARQUET|ORC`, `USING parquet|orc`, `saveAsTable`, `INSERT INTO|OVERWRITE TABLE` → Iceberg-backed tables (`USING iceberg`, `writeTo(...)`)
- **Structured Streaming** and **pyarrow dataset/ParquetFile** are *detected* and left with `TODO(iceberg)` comments for manual rewrite.

Also updates project dependencies (`requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`, `pom.xml`, `build.gradle`).

For the full before/after rewrite matrix per language and the multi-table mapping format, see [examples.md](./examples.md).
For subsystem deep-dives (path schemes, constant folding, partition spec extraction, dynamic SQL loading, dry-run, phased runbook, operational concerns, known limitations) see [reference.md](./reference.md).

## Additional project-specific guides (optional)

`S2T_GUIDE.md` and `ICEBERG_WF_GUIDE.md` listed above are **mandatory** — they ship with this skill and always apply.

Beyond them, **also look for any `*_GUIDE.md` files at the project root of the project being migrated** — project owners use this naming convention for migration-relevant context. If such a guide contradicts SKILL.md defaults (and does not contradict the two mandatory skill guides), the project guide wins.

## Step-by-Step Process

### 1. Identify Project Type

Look for build files to determine stack:
- `requirements.txt` / `pyproject.toml` → **Python**
- `pom.xml` → **Java + Maven**
- `build.gradle` / `build.gradle.kts` → **Java/Scala + Gradle**
- `*.java` / `*.scala` files → JVM project

The skill handles all of these automatically — the detector scans `.py`, `.java`, `.scala` files.

### 2. Detect Parquet / ORC / Hive Usage

Read source files and identify patterns. The skill scans for **both Parquet and ORC** and covers the Spark/pandas/pyarrow idioms below.

**Python:**
- pandas: `pd.read_parquet(...)` / `pd.read_orc(...)` / `.to_parquet(...)` / `.to_orc(...)`
- PySpark batch: `spark.read.parquet|orc(...)` / `df.write.parquet|orc(...)`
- PySpark generic: `spark.read.format("parquet"|"orc").load(...)` / `df.write.format(...).save(...)`
- PySpark streaming *(warn-only)*: `readStream.parquet|orc|format(...)`, `writeStream...`
- pyarrow classic: `pq.read_table(...)` / `pq.write_table(...)`
- pyarrow ORC: `orc.read_table(...)` / `orc.write_table(...)`
- pyarrow dataset *(warn-only)*: `pq.ParquetFile`, `pq.ParquetDataset`, `pa.dataset.dataset`, `pa.dataset.write_dataset`
- SparkSQL via `spark.sql(...)`: `STORED AS PARQUET|ORC`, `USING parquet|orc`, `INSERT INTO|OVERWRITE TABLE`

**Java:**
- Batch: `spark.read().parquet|orc(...)` / `df.write()...parquet|orc(...)`
- Generic: `spark.read().format("parquet"|"orc").load(...)` / `df.write()...format(...).save(...)`
- Streaming *(warn-only)*: `readStream()....`, `writeStream()....`
- `df.write().saveAsTable("...")`
- `spark.sql("CREATE [EXTERNAL] TABLE ... STORED AS PARQUET|ORC")`
- `spark.sql("CREATE TABLE ... USING parquet|orc")`
- `spark.sql("INSERT INTO|OVERWRITE TABLE ...")`

**Scala:** same as Java but with the parens-less `.read.parquet` / `.write.parquet` idiom.

For each detected pattern, refer to [examples.md](./examples.md) for the Iceberg equivalent.

### 3. Get table details from S2T (skip the interactive prompt)

**Per the mandatory [S2T_GUIDE.md](./S2T_GUIDE.md), table details come from S2T, NOT from asking the user.** Concrete steps:

1. Locate `s2t.xlsx` (or `hadoop_S2T_<PROJECT>_v<n>.xlsx`) under `<project>/src/main/resources/s2t/`.
2. Read sheets `Tables` (name, description, storage, location), `Columns` (name, type, nullability, description), `Partitions` (partition column + type).
3. The target Iceberg `(namespace, table)` = `(datamart_name from devops.json, table name from S2T)`. Storage column in S2T flips from `HIVE`/parquet to Iceberg.
4. Capture `entity_id` per table from `src/main/resources/wf/ctl/1_ctl_entities.yml`. You will need it in Step 6 and in the wf yaml.
5. Capture `ТУЗ` (yarn user, `u_<id>`) and `очередь ярн` (`root.g_<...>`) from `mart.yml` / `devops.json`. These go into the Gherkin scenario in `qaapi/*.feature`.

Catalog config comes from [ICEBERG_WF_GUIDE.md](./ICEBERG_WF_GUIDE.md) "Spark-конфигурация для Iceberg" — use `spark_catalog` with `type=hive`. Do NOT propose SQLite or REST — those are out of scope for these datamart projects.

Only ask the user when S2T is missing, ambiguous, or when a table is not yet declared in S2T (in which case add it to S2T first per S2T_GUIDE "Как добавить новую таблицу в S2T" before continuing).

### 4. Generate the Worklist, Then Rewrite

The CLI does **not** rewrite code on its own. It runs the detector, resolves each match against the user's table mapping, updates dependency manifests, and emits `lakehouse-worklist.json` — a per-call-site task list for the agent/LLM to execute via `Edit`.

```bash
python -m skills.open_table_migrator <project_path> --table <TABLE_NAME> --namespace <NAMESPACE>
# or, for multi-table projects:
python -m skills.open_table_migrator <project_path> --mapping ./lakehouse-mapping.json
```

For the mapping file format see the "Multi-table projects" section in [examples.md](./examples.md).
For the `--dry-run` flag (preview the worklist + diffs without writing) see the "Dry run" section in [reference.md](./reference.md).

After the worklist is written, walk each task and apply the rewrite using the Conversion Reference tables in [examples.md](./examples.md). When all tasks are done, rerun the detector — the migrated patterns should be gone, and only `skip: true` entries or `TODO(iceberg)` markers remain.

### 5. Review and Fix Edge Cases

After automated conversion, manually review:

- **Multiple tables** — the tool assumes one table per project; split and re-run per table if needed
- **Schema definitions** — Iceberg requires explicit schema. Extract from existing parquet:
  ```python
  import pyarrow.parquet as pq
  schema = pq.read_schema("existing.parquet")
  ```
- **Partitioning** — partition specifications are extracted structurally from `partitionBy(...)` / `bucketBy(...)` calls and propagated into the worklist. See "Partition spec extraction" in [reference.md](./reference.md) for what's supported and the code↔DDL mismatch detection.
- **Hive metastore catalog** — if the original project used Hive MetaStore, configure Iceberg's HiveCatalog:
  ```
  spark.sql.catalog.hive_prod = org.apache.iceberg.spark.SparkCatalog
  spark.sql.catalog.hive_prod.type = hive
  spark.sql.catalog.hive_prod.uri = thrift://metastore:9083
  ```
- **Existing Hive tables with data** — use Iceberg's `system.migrate` procedure to convert in place:
  ```sql
  CALL hive_prod.system.migrate('db.events')
  ```

For other known caveats (FQN propagation, streaming, pyarrow dataset, viewfs, etc.) see "Known Limitations" in [reference.md](./reference.md).

### 6. Create the Iceberg Table

**Schema is generated from S2T Excel (per S2T_GUIDE.md), TBLPROPERTIES come from ICEBERG_WF_GUIDE.md, catalog is `spark_catalog` with `type=hive`. Do not invent schemas or properties.**

Concrete:

1. Generate / regenerate DDL from `s2t.xlsx` per S2T_GUIDE "Контрольный список перед запуском" (the DDL generator step that turns S2T into `src/main/resources/sql/ddl/<layer>/<table>.sql`). Then change `STORED AS PARQUET` → `USING iceberg`.

```sql
CREATE TABLE {{datamart_name}}.<table> (
  -- columns FROM S2T sheet `Columns` — types/nullability AS-IS from S2T
)
USING iceberg
PARTITIONED BY (
  -- FROM S2T sheet `Partitions` — typically (ctl_loading INT) or part_report_dt
)
TBLPROPERTIES (
  'format-version' = '2',
  'write.parquet.compression-codec' = 'zstd'
  -- MoR vs CoW: ICEBERG_WF_GUIDE does not prescribe a default per table.
  -- Add 'write.update.mode' / 'write.delete.mode' / 'write.merge.mode' = 'merge-on-read'
  -- only when the table has row-level UPDATE/DELETE/MERGE — confirm from DML scripts under
  -- src/main/resources/sql/dml/ before setting these.
);
```

2. Wire the table into compaction per [ICEBERG_WF_GUIDE.md](./ICEBERG_WF_GUIDE.md) — this is **not optional**:
   - Create `src/main/resources/sql/dml/exp_iceberg_<table>.sql` (expire_snapshots) — template in ICEBERG_WF_GUIDE "Expire snapshots only".
   - Create `src/main/resources/sql/dml/upd_iceberg_<table>.sql` (full cycle) — **template choice depends on mode**:
     - **MoR table** (`write.delete.mode=merge-on-read`): use the MoR-aware template — "Полный цикл обслуживания для MoR-таблиц" in ICEBERG_WF_GUIDE. It adds `delete-file-threshold` to `rewrite_data_files`, plus `rewrite_position_delete_files` and `rewrite_manifests` calls. **Required for MoR** — without it, position-delete files accumulate, reads degrade silently.
     - **CoW table** (default): use "Полный цикл обслуживания" — basic `rewrite_data_files` + `remove_orphan_files`.
   - Using the CoW template on a MoR table is a silent footgun. The Phase B plan table records the chosen mode per table; cross-check it here.
   - Add the two `spark_driver_extraJavaOptions__hdfs_care_*` params for the table to the **project's existing maintenance wf** in `src/main/resources/wf/ctl/`. Find it first: `grep -rn 'rewrite_data_files\|expire_snapshots\|exp_iceberg\|hdfs_care' src/main/resources/wf/ctl/`. Common names that may already exist: `wf_schema_hdfs_care`, `wf_<table>_service`, or a project-specific variant. If nothing found, follow ICEBERG_WF_GUIDE "Сценарий 2: Создай отдельный wf для таблицы" and pick a name matching the project's convention — propose 2–3 candidates to the user (`wf_<table>_service` for per-table, `wf_schema_hdfs_care` / `wf_iceberg_maintenance` for shared) and confirm before creating.
   - Use `entity_id` captured in Step 3.

3. Update the Gherkin scenario (`ift.feature` / `st_skl.feature`) per S2T_GUIDE "Шаг 4: Добавь сценарий в Gherkin-файл" — add the new table to the DDL check sub-scenarios.

The `iceberg-runbook/<ns>.<table>/phase2_rewrite.sql` emitted by the migrator is a **template** — in such projects, replace standalone execution with the project's maintenance wf wiring described above. Phase 1 (`add_files`) and Phase 3 (switchover) still apply.

For the rest of the phased rollout (Phase 1 `add_files`, Phase 3 switchover options) and operational background (MoR/CoW, snapshot expiration), see [reference.md](./reference.md) sections "Phased migration runbook" and "Post-Migration Operational Concerns" — but read them through the lens of ICEBERG_WF_GUIDE.md (wf/ctl wiring, not standalone Spark jobs).

### 7. Run Existing Tests

**Python:**
```bash
pip install pyiceberg[sql-sqlite]
pytest tests/ -v
```

**Java/Maven:**
```bash
mvn test
```

**Scala/Gradle:**
```bash
./gradlew test
```

Common test failures:
- Tests use `tmp_path` for parquet file path but Iceberg catalog uses a fixed URI — inject catalog via fixture
- Assertions on file existence (`Path("data.parquet").exists()`) — replace with table existence checks

### 8. Commit

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "refactor: migrate parquet read/write to Apache Iceberg"
```

## Where to look next

- **[examples.md](./examples.md)** — conversion reference tables (Python, Java/Scala, Hive/SparkSQL), dependencies added per ecosystem, multi-table mapping file format.
- **[reference.md](./reference.md)** — operational concerns (MoR/CoW, compaction, snapshot expiration), path schemes (s3/hdfs/abfs/gs/viewfs/file), constant folding rules, partition spec extraction, dynamic SQL loading, dry-run mode, phased migration runbook, known limitations.
